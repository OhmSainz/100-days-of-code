**Today's Progress**: Feels good to be back at coding. I know that I'm not a newbie but I want to do all things good and updating my portfolio [I need an update]. (:

**Thoughts** In 2016, I left programming and started Uni again, studying Psychology... This is the first day when I return to programming world. ~

### Day 3: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Today, I've tried to write more code, but I can't write more because I have a bug... "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token import" using ES6 Syntax in JavaScript

**Thoughts** I have reading, reading and more reading... First day when I wrote less but I'm not frustrated, I know tomorrow I will solve and fix this bug!
