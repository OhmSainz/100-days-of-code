### Day 1: January 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Feels good to be back at coding. I know that I'm not a newbie but I want to do all things good and updating my portfolio [I need an update]. (:

**Thoughts** In 2016, I left programming and started Uni again, studying Psychology... This is the first day when I return to programming world. ~
